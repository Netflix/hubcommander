Command Configuration
====================
Commands in HubCommander are setup in such a way that they can be modified.

All plugins in HubCommander expose commands via a `dict`. For example, 
see the [`github/plugin.py`](https://github.com/Netflix/hubcommander/blob/master/github/plugin.py#L23)'s 
`init()` method.

In there, there is a `self.commands = {}`. The `dict` entry is the case-sensitive command with a nested `dict` with the
command configuration. At a minimum, each command has the following fields:

   - `command`: The specific command (ALWAYS prefixed with `!`). This is the **SAME** as the dict entry name.
                This is case sensitive for the dict, but the command itself that the user executes is not 
                case sensitive. 
   - `help`: This is the help text for the command that will be output when running
             the `!help` command.
   - `user_data_required`: This should generally be set to `True`. This means that the function
                           will reference the user that sent the command in (like for `@` mentions).
   - `enabled`: Either `True` or `False`. Disabled commands will not be reachable.
   - `func`: This is the actual function that will be run to process the command.
   
Additional Configuration
------------------------
Commands can have additional configuration to disable commands and to enable authentication for them.

In the plugin's respective `config.py` file, there is a `dict` named `USER_COMMAND_DICT`. This dictionary is
merged with the plugin's commands in the `setup()` method on startup. This is where you will make command-specific
configuration settings.

### Disabling Commands
By default, all commands are enabled. To disable a command, you need to add an `enabled: False` to the
`USER_COMMAND_DICT`'s entry for the command. For example to disable the ability to create new repositories,
you would set the GitHub plugin's `USER_COMMAND_DICT` to contain:
```
USER_COMMAND_DICT = {
 "!CreateRepo": {
     "enabled": False
 }
}
```

### Enabling Authentication
By default, authentication is disabled. An example of enabling authentication can be see in the GitHub plugin's
[`config.py`](https://github.com/Netflix/hubcommander/blob/master/github/config.py) file.

_For more details on authentication plugins, please read the [authentication plugin documentation](authentication.md)._


### Hidden Commands

If you ever retire a command, you can make it hidden from the `!Help` output. You can modify the command so that it
outputs information redirecting the user to the new and supported command to utilize.

To do this, in the command configuration, simply remove the `help` text. This command can stil be
executed, but won't appear as a command.
